Does your project run without error?: For the most part

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

About 1 in 15 times if you refresh the page the amounts spent don't update properly
I think it may be a race condition issue
Just refresh again and it should fix itself


Additional comments to the grader:
While it says explicitly that you need to add the date of purchase, it does not actually say explicitly anywhere that you need to do anything with them.
Have a nice day, cheers
